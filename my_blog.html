        <p><h2>How to Use Codepen</h2></p>
        <p>Codepen is an online <em>IDE</em> 
            that allows you to create website freely. 
            With codepen, you won't need to use 
            the boiler plate in HTML neither would 
            you use any styling links
        </p>

        <p><h2>How to Style Using HTML</h2></p>
            <p>styling with <em>HTML</em> is made possible
                with the use of attributes. It is made 
                possible with the style attribute, such 
                that text color, backgroung-color,
                font-size and many other is possible.
                <p>But note, manipulations are mainly 
                    done on the text.
                </p>

        <p><h2 style="color: #FFB84B;">How to Save and Use Image Link</h2></p>
        <p>Having to always store images on your local in creating of your site may lead to image loss in the long run.<p>
           <strong><em>How&quest;</em></strong> senerios might happen when your storage device might get corrupted or tempered with
           which may lead to loss of important pieces which where used in storing your code.<br>
           But having to store your images online gives you an extra insurrance of always getting that image provided the link to that site can be called upon.
            <p>
                <em>Note:</em> 
                Uploading your code online 
                helps create a safe backup for you.
